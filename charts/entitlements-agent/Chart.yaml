apiVersion: v2
name: entitlements-agent
description: A Helm chart for frontegg's entitlements agent with SpiceDB (SpiceDB + CockroachDB + SpiceDB Sync + MCP Server). Supports both manual CockroachDB deployment and CockroachDB Operator.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.4.0
